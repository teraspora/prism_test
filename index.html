				<p>SECURITY

				an Asterisk server.
			
				See [Important Security Considerations] for more information.
			
				</p>
<p>WHAT IS ASTERISK ?
			
				Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit. It is, in a
				sense, middleware between Internet and telephony channels on the bottom,
				and Internet and telephony applications at the top. However, Asterisk supports
				more telephony interfaces than just Internet telephony. Asterisk also has a
				vast amount of support for traditional PSTN telephony, as well.
			
				For more information on the project itself, please visit the Asterisk
				[home page] and the official [wiki]. In addition you'll find lots
				of information compiled by the Asterisk community at [voip-info.org].
			
				There is a book on Asterisk published by O'Reilly under the Creative Commons
				License. It is available in book stores as well as in a downloadable version on
				the [asteriskdocs.org] web site.
			
				</p>
<h3>SUPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS</h3>
<p>Linux</p>
			
				<blockquote>
					The Asterisk Open Source PBX is developed and tested primarily on the
					GNU/Linux operating system, and is supported on every major GNU/Linux
					distribution.

			<h2>Third-party tutorials</h2>
			<p>
				Supports parallelism with Web Workers, if available. Disabled by default (why?).
				Very easy to extend without modifying the code, due to Prism’s plugin architecture. Multiple hooks are scattered
				throughout the source.
				Very easy to define new languages. Only thing you need is a good understanding of regular expressions
				All styling is done through CSS, with sensible class names rather than ugly namespaced abbreviated nonsense.
				Wide browser support: Edge, IE11, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, most Mobile browsers
				Highlights embedded languages (e.g. CSS inside HTML, JavaScript inside HTML)
				Highlights inline code as well, not just code blocks
				Highlights nested languages (CSS in HTML, JavaScript in HTML)
				It doesn’t force you to use any Prism-specific markup, not even a Prism-specific class name, only standard markup you
				should be using anyway. So, you can just try it for a while, remove it if you don’t like it and leave no traces behind.
				Highlight specific lines and/or line ranges (requires plugin)
				Show invisible characters like tabs, line breaks etc (requires plugin)
